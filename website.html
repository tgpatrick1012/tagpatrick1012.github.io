    <h1>Bio:</h1>

I am a girl from Chicago, IL, who sleeps 25/8. I will be in the 11th grade in the fall, attending Jones College Prep, and I am looking forward to taking the SAT. I live with my parents, my brothers, my sisters, and my cats named Catman and Starrynight. When I'm not studying, you can find me listening to music with my friends or sleeping.

    <h2>Likes:</h2>
I like to sleep and listening to music

    <h2>Dislikes:</h2>
I really don't like rollercoasters. Heights scare me and it goes too fast!

    <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
So far, I've been to 28 different states! I can't wait to see the others.
